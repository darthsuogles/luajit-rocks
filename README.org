#+TITLE: CMake-based LuaJIT + Luarocks

# What's the point? #

We want to provide an easy to way to users for installing _recent_ versions
of LuaJIT (or Lua) and luarocks, with almost no efforts.

The provided LuaJIT (or Lua) and luarocks point on their respective git
repository. We did not make any changes, except the compilation and
installation process.

In addition,
  - Luarocks (or Lua) will be installed at the same location than LuaJIT and will know
    about LuaJIT shared library location (mandatory for Windows installs). It will
    also not be confused if you have several LuaJIT+luarocks at different locations.

  - Luarocks will come installed with [Torch rocks repository](http://torch.github.io/rocks.html).
  
  - Luarocks comes with mandatory system command line tools under Windows.

  - Readline support for LuaJIT.
  
* First Time Installation
# Pre-requisites

Install [[http://cmake.org][cmake]] on your system.

# Installation

#+begin_src sh  
git clone https://github.com/torch/luajit-rocks.git
cd luajit-rocks
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/prefix
#+end_src

Then under Unix systems:
#+begin_src sh 
make install
#+end_src

Under Windows:
#+begin_src sh 
nmake install
#+end_src

Note: we do not recommend (nor we support) installation under Cygwin.

** Additional CMake flags

  - If you prefer vanilla Lua 5.1 instead of LuaJIT, use `-DWITH_LUA51=ON`
  - If you prefer vanilla Lua 5.2 instead of LuaJIT, use `-DWITH_LUA52=ON`
  - If you prefer LuaJIT 2.1 instead of LuaJIT 2.0, use `-DWITH_LUAJIT21=ON`
